from an early age, I fell in love with video games and SFX effects in animations and movies. 
so I decided to embark on my odyssey and started learning whatever I can put my hands hoping that it will help
me to achieve my dream one day which is creating my own game on the same level as the "legend of Zelda" series
and share my knowledge with people around so more people get invested in learning game development.
