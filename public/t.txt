I am a computer engineering student at Ain shams university and currently studying computer graphics as my major.
My goal is to be a future game developer and create my own game which will hopefully someday have a positive effect on someone's state of mind like how the Celeste was for me.
For the time being, I am learning all I can have my hands on and I am aiming at the end of this year to start my Youtube channel to teach people in a fun and innovative way about the graphics major which not a lot of people are a fan of(mainly in Egypt).
